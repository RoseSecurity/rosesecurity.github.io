> Hey, I'm **RoseSecurity**!

> I build tools that make managing infrastructure easier to run and safer to scale. Day-to-day I'm in the Terraform and Go trenches, maintaining widely used modules, authoring providers, and contributing to [Terraform Best Practices](https://www.terraform-best-practices.com/) and [Terraform Proverbs](https://rosesecurity.dev/2024/11/24/terraform-proverbs.html). Beyond infrastructure, I architect data engineering pipelines and specialize in building scalable ML/AI platforms for companies in the cloud. I live in the CLI, am the creator of Red-Teaming TTPs, and am a [MITRE](https://attack.mitre.org/resources/engage-with-attack/contribute/), [OWASP](https://nest.owasp.org/members/RoseSecurity), and [Debian](https://nm.debian.org/person/rosesecurity/) contributor!
