## _Simple, Clear, Maintainable_

---

Clear is better than clever.

Automate the toil, not the thinking.

If you can't see it, you can't fix it.

Serve the workload, not the infrastructure.

Today's shortcut is tomorrow's incident.

An untested backup is no backup at all.

Roll out in waves, not floods.

Hope is not a strategy.

Be careful what you measure, because that's exactly what you'll get.

The best postmortem is the one you act on.

Tribal knowledge dies with the tribe.

The best infrastructure is the kind you can forget about.
