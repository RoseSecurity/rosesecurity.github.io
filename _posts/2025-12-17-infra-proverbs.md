## _Simple, Clear, Maintainable_

---

Clear is better than clever.

Automate the toil, not the thinking.

If you can't see it, you can't fix it.

Serve the workload, not the infrastructure.

Today's shortcut is tomorrow's incident.

An untested backup is no backup at all.

Roll out in waves, not floods.

Hope is not a strategy.
