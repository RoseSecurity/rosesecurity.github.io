  I build tools that make managing infrastructure easier to run and safer to scale. Day-to-day I’m in the Terraform and Go trenches, maintaining widely used modules, authoring providers, and contributing to Terraform Best Practices and Terraform Proverbs. Beyond infrastructure, I architect data engineering pipelines and specialize in building scalable ML/AI platforms for companies in the cloud. I live in the CLI, am the creator of Red-Teaming TTPs, and am a MITRE, OWASP, and Debian contributor!

  If you enjoy my community code, blogs, or tools, feel free to reach out and connect!
