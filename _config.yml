  I build tools to simplify managing infra for startups and enterprise businesses. My goal has always been to create automation that makes building secure, scalable cloud environments fast and efficient without compromising on quality. When I'm not hacking on Terraform or Go code, you can catch me conducting security research to stay ahead of evolving threats targeting companies in the cloud.
