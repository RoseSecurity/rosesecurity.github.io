# Terraform Proverbs

<img src="../static/img/terraform-logo.png" alt="terraform_logo" style="width:60%;">

## Simple, Clear, Maintainable

Clear is better than clever.  

Version everything.  

Modules should be reusable, not rigid.  

Outputs are for sharing.  

Tags are free; use them liberally.  

Count versus for_each is essential.  

Descriptions are for users.  

Use positive variable names to avoid double negatives.  

Null is not the same as nothing.  

Prefer a single object over many related variables.  

Terraform is declarative; trust it to converge.  

Never output secrets.  

Upgrade deliberately, not impulsively.  

Name with underscores, not dashes.  

Using locals makes code descriptive and maintainable.
