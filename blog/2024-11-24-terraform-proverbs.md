## _Simple, Clear, Maintainable_

---

Clear is better than clever.

Version everything.

Modules should be reusable, not rigid.

Outputs are for sharing.

Tags are free; use them liberally.

Count versus for_each is essential.

Descriptions are for users.

Use positive variable names to avoid double negatives.

Null is not the same as nothing.

Prefer a single object over many related variables.

Terraform is declarative; trust it to converge.

Never output secrets.

Upgrade deliberately, not impulsively.

Name with underscores, not dashes.

Using locals makes code descriptive and maintainable.
