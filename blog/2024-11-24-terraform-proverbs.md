  <strong>Terraform Proverbs</strong>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <em>Simple, Clear, Maintainable</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
  Clear is better than clever.<br>
  Version everything.<br>
  Modules should be reusable, not rigid.<br>
  Outputs are for sharing.<br>
  Tags are free; use them liberally.<br>
  Count versus for_each is essential.<br>
  Descriptions are for users.<br>
  Use positive variable names to avoid double negatives.<br>
  Null is not the same as nothing.<br>
  Prefer a single object over many related variables.<br>
  Terraform is declarative; trust it to converge.<br>
  Never output secrets.<br>
  Upgrade deliberately, not impulsively.<br>
  Name with underscores, not dashes.<br>
  Using locals makes code descriptive and maintainable.
